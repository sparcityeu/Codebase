# Codebase

Codebase contains source code for various tools and frameworks produced during SparCity project execution.

## Performance Evaluation

### Parallel Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication Performance Evaluation Tool

[spmv-perf](spmv-perf) tool is used to evaluate performance of different SpMV kernels on CPU and GPU architectures.  

## Performance Monitoring Tools

### Inter-Thread Communication Monitoring Tool

[ComDetective](https://github.com/ParCoreLab/hpctoolkit) tool is used to capture inter-thread communication in the form of communication matrix.  

### Reuse Distance Analysis Tool

[ReuseTracker](https://github.com/ParCoreLab/ReuseTracker) tool is used to measure reuse distance in private and shared caches on multithreaded code.

## Mixed and Multi-Precision SpMV
